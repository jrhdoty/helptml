I'm providing an HTML & CSS workshop to allow more people to try their ideas in the medium for which we design our products.

The workshop meets Thursday @ 5pm and offers office hours on Tuesdays @ 5pm 

You need nothing more than a laptop, a text editor, and a browser for this workshop. Windows + Notepad + Internet Explorer is just as good as Mac + TextEdit + Safari for what I plan to cover.
